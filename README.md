# teascript.org

A work in progress website for Teascript

This project uses Hugo. To get started, install the lastest version of Hugo [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

After that, run the following command to preview the site:

```bash
hugo server
```

You may need to use `--disableFastRender` flag in case of the site changes not applying properly on preview:

```bash
hugo server --disableFastRender
```
